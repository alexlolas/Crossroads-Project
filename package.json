  "description": "Background: In my Crossroads game, I am going to be taking inspiration from an app called  Crossy-Roads and a more classic game known as Frogger. The basis of the game is  to make it to the top of the screen without getting hit by obsticales along the way. It will be a 2-D game with \"W,A,S,D\" movement keys. There will be multiple  levels in the game, starting with easier levels that will quickly ramp up in difficulty as the levels progress on. You will be given three lives, if you get hit by any obsitcles on the way to the top, you will respawn back at the  bottom of the screen with a life taken away. As you progress you will experience  new features that will make the game signicificantly harder, such as enemy npcs and projectiles.",
