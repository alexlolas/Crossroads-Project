# Crossroads-Project

Background:
In my Crossroads game, I am going to be taking inspiration from an app called 
Crossy-Roads and a more classic game known as Frogger. The basis of the game is 
to make it to the top of the screen without getting hit by obsticales along the
way. It will be a 2-D game with "W,A,S,D" movement keys. There will be multiple 
levels in the game, starting with easier levels that will quickly ramp up in
difficulty as the levels progress on. You will be given three lives, if you
get hit by any obsitcles on the way to the top, you will respawn back at the 
bottom of the screen with a life taken away. As you progress you will experience 
new features that will make the game signicificantly harder, such as enemy
npcs and projectiles. 

Functionality & MVPS

In Crossroads, users will be able to:
- Move around with 'W,A,S,D' keys.
- Be able to dive forward with the space bar to dodge close calls.
- Move backwards if they realize they made a mistake by jumping forward.
- Progress through levels if they reach the top of the string.
- Get a second and third chance if they get hit by something. 

In addition, this project will include:
- Instructions on the screen explaining the controls.
- A brief summary of the goal of the game and how to win.
- A display showing the amount of lives they have left.
- A pannel to restart, pause the game, and quit the game.

Tehcnologies:
I will be mostly using the canvas API to render my game, other than that the code
will be all written in JavaScript and will use Vanilla Javascript to implement HTML.
I will also be using Sprite libraries for models of characters and objects.

Implementation Timeline:
Friday Afternoon & Weekend: On Friday I need to look more into what it takes to 
build out the logic of the game, and I hope to at least have a rendered board by
then end of the day. Over the weekend I am hoping to get moving objects and a base
character.

Monday: I want to be able to move my characater by the end of the day monday which
takes a lot of logic to back it up.

Tuesday: I want to have my initial levels and maybe a few more levels pastthat figured 
out.

Wednesday: I want to work on character models and make sure everything is looking nice.

Thursday: I want to fine tune anything that might need fixing.
